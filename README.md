# 🌱 Soil Profiling and Crop Recommendation using ML
A machine learning project that analyzes soil properties to recommend suitable crops. It features soil clustering, PCA-based visualization, yield data integration, and crop prediction using Random Forest. Ideal for farmers and researchers seeking data-driven agricultural insights.

## 🚀 Features
- Crop prediction using Random Forest
- Soil clustering using KMeans
- PCA-based visualization
- Yield data analysis
- Interactive plots with Plotly

## 📦 Dataset
- [Crop Recommendation using Soil Properties and Weather Prediction](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8v757rr4st/1)
- `yield_df.csv`: Supplementary dataset for crop yield insights

## 🛠 Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## 📈 Usage
Run the notebook `soil_crop_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab. Upload both datasets and execute the cells to preprocess data, visualize clusters, train models, and get crop recommendations.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Random Forest
- KMeans Clustering
- PCA

## 📊 Visuals
- Confusion matrix
- Feature importance
- Soil clustering map
- PCA scatter plot
